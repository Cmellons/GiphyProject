Ideas for Future Improvement- 
(1) Infinite Scroll Functionality: Implement infinite scroll to allow users to keep scrolling down, loading more GIFs automatically instead of having to click a "Load More" button or paginate through results. This would enhance user experience by providing a seamless way to discover more content.

(2) User Favorites and History: Add functionality for users to mark GIFs as favorites and to save their search history. This would require some form of local storage or backend database to keep track of user preferences and history, offering a more personalized experience for return visitors.

(3) Advanced Search Options: Introduce advanced search filters such as searching by GIF rating, upload date, or specifying the type of content (e.g., stickers vs. GIFs). This would give users more control over the search results and help them find more specific content.

(4) Social Sharing and Integration: Add social sharing options for each GIF, allowing users to share their favorite GIFs on social media platforms directly from the website. Additionally, integrating with social media APIs could enable features like displaying trending GIFs based on social media popularity.
